-- 2) Create a table called students.
/*
	3) Add the following columns:
		id
		last_name
		first_name
		birth_date
		The id must be auto_incremented.
		Make sure to choose the correct data type for each column.
		To help, here is the data that you will have to insert. (How do we insert a date to a table?)

/*====== INSERT ========*/
-- 1)Insert the data seen above to the students table. Find the most efficient way to insert the data.
INSERT INTO students(first_name, last_name, birth_date)

		 ('David', 'Grez', '14/06/2003'),
		 ('Omer', 'Simpson', '03/10/1980')
		 
-- 2)Insert your last_name, first_name and birth_date to the students table (Take a look at the id given)
INSERT INTO students(first_name, last_name, birth_date)

/*========== SELECT =============*/

-- 1) Fetch all of the data from the table.
SELECT * FROM students

-- 2) Fetch all of the students first_names and last_names.
SELECT students.first_name, students.last_name

-- 3)For the following questions, only fetch the first_names and last_names of the students.
	-- 1) Fetch the student which id is equal to 2. 
SELECT students.first_name, students.last_name

	-- 4) Fetch the students whose first_names contain the letter a.
SELECT students.first_name, students.last_name
FROM students
WHERE students.first_name ILIKE '%a%'

	-- 5) Fetch the students whose first_names start with the letter a.
SELECT students.first_name, students.last_name
FROM students
WHERE students.first_name ILIKE 'a%'

	-- 6) Fetch the students whose first_names end with the letter a.
SELECT students.first_name, students.last_name
